Python program is to run without interrupts if possible.
Program flow:

Program start:
  Read cal file
  Init all devices
  Board/ system test
  Report errors and write to log file
  Begin program loop:
    Check and display cross and long levels
    Beam servo (loop 10 times)
      Display beam on OLED
      Adjust PWM
   Check for communications
      Set flags for data reporting
   Check communications flags
   Get time
      if single reading flag set:
          if(beam is level):
              Send data
              clear flag
     if continuous reading flag is set:
        if it 1 Hz GPIO is set high:
          if(beam is level):
              Send data
              Clear GPIO flag
    if(time min counter is 10):
        Check system status/ voltages etc.
        Report errors and write to log file
